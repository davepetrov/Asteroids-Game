## Q/A:

**How many players can play at a time?**

The program requires 2 or 3 players at a time. Rules are explained in the menu

**What are the controls?**

Depending on your operating system, the rules are shown once the user selects how many players are playing. I have noticed that macs have this glitch of not loading the screen. (odd - will fix eventually). If you happen to have this issue, rules cnan be found in *./screens/[two-Rules.jpg/threeRules.jpg]*
